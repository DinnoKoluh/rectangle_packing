There are two files in the 'src' folder. The 'main_smt.ipynb' file is used for code execution (for the base and rotational model) and the file
'funs_smt.py' contains all the functions used to solve the problem.

IMPORTANT: All the files from the 'src' folder should be in the same folder where the folders 'out', 'figs', 'out_rots', 'figs_rots' 
and 'instances' are, as they read/write the solutions from these folders.

The needed libraries are: z3, matplotlib, random, time.
