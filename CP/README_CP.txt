There are three files in the 'src' folder. The 'main_cp.py' file is used for the base model, the 'main_cp_rot.py' is used for the rotational model
and the file 'funs_cp.py' contains all the functions used to solve the problem.

IMPORTANT: All the files from the 'src' folder should be in the same folder where the folders 'out', 'figs', 'out_rots', 'figs_rots' and 
'instances' are, as they read/write the solutions from these folders.

The needed libraries are: minizinc, datetime, matplotlib, time.
